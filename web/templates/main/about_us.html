                        <h4>Prevention</h4>
                        <p>CLINTERPOL believes that institutions should put the right proactive measures in place and to take appropriate foresighted and deliberate actions to reduce opportunities for crime, losses as well as negative security and safety
                            incidences. CLINTERPOL believes that reactive firefighting responses are expensive, cumbersome, reputation damaging and actual recovery and restoration may be impossible to achieve.
