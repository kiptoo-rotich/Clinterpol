                            <h4>Prevention is Better than Cure, Information and Knowledge is Power</h4>
                            <p><b>CLINTERPOL</b> was incorporated in 2011, our approach to the problem of crime and insecurity are anchored on two pillars: Prevention is better than cure and Information and knowledge is power. We believe that sustainable
                                management of insecurity, crime and conflict should be intelligence led. Failure by institutions and individuals to take preventive and proactive steps to avoid being victims of crime and insecurity, ensures that a lot
                                of resources and time are used to react majorly through lengthy investigations and litigations, some taking as long as over a decade. This is not good for business as it slows progress and development.</p>

                            <p>CLINTERPOL services majorly seeks to cushion institutions from falling prey to the insidious act of crime and insecurity such as fraud and theft by acting proactively with a preventive mindset, before their occurrence and not
                                post facto. We are the gateway to sources of knowledge and information critical and instrumental for any institution that intends to rely on intelligence-led, timely, accurate and relevant information and knowledge to arrive
                                at sustainable, development and growth conscious corporate decisions. Reactive, firefighting, responses long after the fact is tedious, litigation fraught, expensive, time consuming and reputation soiling.</p>
